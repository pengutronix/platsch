platsch - Splash Screen Application
===================================

platsch is a simple splash screen application meant to be run as PID 1
(``init=/usr/sbin/platsch``).

The image to be displayed for each DRM connector is expected here::

  /usr/share/platsch/splash-<width>x<height>-<format>.bin

By default platsch uses the first mode on each DRM connector. ``<format>``
defaults to ``RGB565``. See below how to change that behavior.

Splash screen images must have the specified resolution and format. See
below how to generate them.

After displaying the splash screen(s), platsch forks, sending its child to
sleep to keep the DRM device open and the splash image(s) on the display(s).
Finally platsch gives PID 1 to ``/sbin/init``. Later another application can
simply take over.

Seamless transitions are possible (e.g. to *Weston* having the same image
configured as background). Depending on the SoC used, the same format might be
required to achieve that.

Splash Image Generation
-----------------------

*ImageMagick* can be used to prepare the required splash images. Since it
outputs "bottom-up" BMPs, flip them to compensate for that. Alpha channel is
enabled/disabled depending on whether RGB or XRGB format is desired. Finally
only the actual pixel data is extracted. Since a color profile might follow the
pixel data, strip that.

RGB565
^^^^^^

This generates a 1920x1080 splash image in ``RGB565`` format from a png file::

  #!/bin/bash
  magick \
    /path/to/source.png \
    -resize 1920x1080\! \
    -flip \
    -alpha off \
    -strip \
    -define bmp:subtype=RGB565 \
    bmp:- | tail -c $((1920*1080*(5+6+5)/8)) > \
    splash-1920x1080-RGB565.bin

XRGB8888
^^^^^^^^

This generates a 1920x1080 splash image in ``XRGB8888`` format from a png
file::

  #!/bin/bash
  magick \
    /path/to/source.png \
    -resize 1920x1080\! \
    -flip \
    -alpha on \
    -strip \
    bmp:- | tail -c $((1920*1080*(8+8+8+8)/8)) > \
    splash-1920x1080-XRGB8888.bin

Configuration
-------------

The directory searched for the splash images (default: ``/usr/share/platsch``),
as well as the image files' basename (default: ``splash``) can be controlled via
the environment variables ``platsch_directory`` and ``platsch_basename`` (which
in the case of PID != 1 would be overridden by the corresponding commandline
parameters, see further downwards).

For each connector a corresponding environment variable is looked up::

  platsch_<connector-type-name><connector-type-id>_mode

``<connector-type-name>`` is a lowercase string libdrm returns for
``drmModeGetConnectorTypeName()``, "-" replaced with "_". The variable is
expected to contain the mode's resolution and image format, optionally::

  <width>x<height>[@<format>]

I.e. to set the mode matching a resolution of 800x600 and default format on
``LVDS-1``::

  platsch_lvds1_mode=800x600

Or a resolution of 1920x1080 and ``XRGB8888`` format on ``LVDS-2``::

  platsch_lvds2_mode=1920x1080@XRGB8888

The kernel passes unrecognized key-value parameters not containing dots into
init's environment, see
`Kernel Parameter Documentation <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html>`_.
Therefore the above settings can be supplied via the kernel commandline. This
also allows dynamic use cases where the bootloader decides which resolution/mode
to use on which connector.

Commandline Arguments
---------------------

If the program is used in later Linux userspace (PID != 1), platsch recognizes a
couple of command line arguments:

``--directory`` or ``-d`` sets the directory containing the splash screens.

``--basename`` or ``-b`` sets the prefix of the splash screen file names.

Compiling Instructions
----------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    meson setup build
    meson compile -C build

To ensure fast startup, ``platsch`` prefers using static libraries:

.. code-block:: shell

    meson setup -Dprefer_static=true build
    meson compile -C build
